The data file includes three variables.

* **Condition**: The condition participants were pre-exposed too. The three conditions were two goal orientations, mastery and performance, and the third condition was neutral.

* **Gender**: We incorporated the male and female genders in our study to measure the difference in results acquired based on gender and the pre-exposure to the description paragraph.

* **Results**: The survey scores from each participant are listed, ranging from a low of 7 to a high of 16. Having a high score indicated that the participant identified more as mastery goal oriented rather than performance oriented. While having a low score indicates that the participant identified more as performance goal oriented rather than mastery oriented. As can be seen, most participants self-identified as mastery oriented.
